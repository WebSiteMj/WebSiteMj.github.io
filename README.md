## About me: 
Experienced Software Engineer with nearly 3 years of full-stack development expertise, 
specializing in scalable solutions using C#, .NET, Blazor, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. With a 
strong foundation in analyzing requirements and writing clean, efficient code, I excel in 
managing deployments and fostering team collaboration. 
After a 7-year tenure in C#, ASP.NET, and SQL Server, I resumed my career in 2022, bringing 
renewed energy and focus. Most recently, I successfully managed a project from inception to 
delivery, utilizing Scrum methodologies to ensure timely completion and alignment with business 
objectives. My Master in Business Administration enhances my capability to bridge the gap 
between technical solutions and strategic business goals. 
In my last project, I took the initiative to engage directly with the customer, gathering 
requirements and managing the project in Azure DevOps. This experience not only honed my 
project management skills but also reinforced my commitment to delivering value-driven 
solutions.
